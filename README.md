# Game Couple bot
My first telegram bot created on basis of a game "Couple".

Bot is written on `python 3.6` with the use of:
* aiogram
* redis
* SQLAlchemy

##### Language: Russian

Working version: [@gamecouplebot](http://t.me/GameCoupleBot)

# How it works
![use_bot](https://github.com/OnlineAlex/game-couple-tgbot/blob/master/use-bot.gif)

# How to launch it
Script needs for its work to install an interpreter Python version 3.6 and above

And packages from requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # or pip3
```

In `config.py` is changed `TOKEN` and `developer_id`

> The launch for all the OS is the same
With the help of the standard command `python` (or `python3`).
```bash
$ python couple_bot.py
```
